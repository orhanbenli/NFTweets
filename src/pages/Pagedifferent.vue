      NFTs vs. Crypto: What's the Difference?
    </h4>
    <div class="text-body1 text-justify">
      <p>
        NFT stands for non-fungible token. It's generally built using the same
        kind of programming as cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but
        that's where the similarity ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Physical money and cryptocurrencies are “fungible,” meaning they can be
        traded or exchanged for one another. They're also equal in value—one
        dollar is always worth another dollar; one Bitcoin is always equal to
        another Bitcoin. Crypto's fungibility makes it a trusted means of
        conducting transactions on the blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
        NFTs are different. Each has a digital signature that makes it
        impossible for NFTs to be exchanged for or equal to one another (hence,
        non-fungible). One NBA Top Shot clip, for example, is not equal to
        EVERYDAYS simply because they're both NFTs. (One NBA Top Shot clip isn't
        even necessarily equal to another NBA Top Shot clip, for that matter.)
