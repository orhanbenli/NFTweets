        An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art,
        music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online,
        frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the
        same underlying software as many cryptos.
      </p>

        Although they've been around since 2014, NFTs are gaining notoriety now
        because they are becoming an increasingly popular way to buy and sell
        digital artwork. The market for NFTs was worth a staggering $41 billion
        in 2021 alone, an amount that is approaching the total value of the
        entire global fine art market.

        NFTs are also generally one of a kind, or at least one of a very limited
        run, and have unique identifying codes. “Essentially, NFTs create
        digital scarcity,” says Arry Yu, chair of the Washington Technology
        Industry Association Cascadia Blockchain Council and managing director
        of Yellow Umbrella Ventures.

        This stands in stark contrast to most digital creations, which are
        almost always infinite in supply. Hypothetically, cutting off the supply
        should raise the value of a given asset, assuming it's in demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        But many NFTs, at least in these early days, have been digital creations
        that already exist in some form elsewhere, like iconic video clips from
        NBA games or securitized versions of digital art that's already floating
        around on Instagram.

        Famous digital artist Mike Winklemann, better known as “Beeple,” crafted
        a composite of 5,000 daily drawings to create perhaps the most famous
        NFT of 2021, “EVERYDAYS: The First 5000 Days,” which sold at Christie's
        for a record-breaking $69.3 million.

        Anyone can view the individual images—or even the entire collage of
        images online for free. So why are people willing to spend millions on
        something they could easily screenshot or download?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because an NFT allows the buyer to own the original item. Not only that,
        it contains built-in authentication, which serves as proof of ownership.
        Collectors value those “digital bragging rights” almost more than the
        item itself.
