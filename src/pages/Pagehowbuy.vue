        First, you'll need to get a digital wallet that allows you to store NFTs
        and cryptocurrencies. You'll likely need to purchase some

        provider accepts. You can buy crypto using a credit card on platforms
        like Coinbase, Kraken, eToro and even PayPal and Robinhood now. You'll

        You'll want to keep fees in mind as you research options. Most exchanges
        charge at least a percentage of your transaction when you buy crypto.
