      <p>Once you've got your wallet set up and funded, there's no shortage of NFT sites to shop. Currently, the largest NFT marketplaces are:</p>
      <p><span class="text-weight-bold">OpenSea.io</span>: This peer-to-peer platform bills itself a purveyor of “rare digital items and collectibles.” To get started, all you need to do is create an account to browse NFT collections. You can also sort pieces by sales volume to discover new artists.</p>
      <p><span class="text-weight-bold">Rarible</span>: Similar to OpenSea, Rarible is a democratic, open marketplace that allows artists and creators to issue and sell NFTs. RARI tokens issued on the platform enable holders to weigh in on features like fees and community rules.</p>
      <p><span class="text-weight-bold">Foundation</span>: Here, artists must receive “upvotes” or an invitation from fellow creators to post their art. The community's exclusivity and cost of entry—artists must also purchase “gas” to mint NFTs—means it may boast higher-caliber artwork. For instance, Nyan Cat creator Chris Torres sold the NFT on the Foundation platform. It may also mean higher prices — not necessarily a bad thing for artists and collectors seeking to capitalize, assuming the demand for NFTs remains at current levels, or even increases over time.</p>
      <p>Although these platforms and others are host to thousands of NFT creators and collectors, be sure you do your research carefully before buying. Some artists have fallen victim to impersonators who have listed and sold their work without their permission.</p>
      <p>In addition, the verification processes for creators and NFT listings aren't consistent across platforms — some are more stringent than others. OpenSea and Rarible, for example, do not require owner verification for NFT listings. Buyer protections appear to be sparse at best, so when shopping for NFTs, it may be best to keep the old adage “caveat emptor” (let the buyer beware) in mind.</p>
