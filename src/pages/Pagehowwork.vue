        NFTs exist on a blockchain, which is a distributed public ledger that
        records transactions. You're probably most familiar with blockchain as
        the underlying process that makes cryptocurrencies possible.

        Specifically, NFTs are typically held on the Ethereum blockchain,
        although other blockchains support them as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        An NFT is created, or “minted” from digital objects that represent both
        tangible and intangible items, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Grafic art</li>
        <li>GIFs</li>
        <li>Videos and sports highlights</li>
        <li>Collectibles</li>
        <li>Virtual avatars and video game skins</li>
        <li>Designer sneakers</li>
        <li>Music</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even tweets count. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey sold his first ever
        tweet as an NFT for more than $2.9 million.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially, NFTs are like physical collector's items, only digital. So
        instead of getting an actual oil painting to hang on the wall, the buyer
        gets a digital file instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also get exclusive ownership rights. NFTs can have only one owner
        at a time, and their use of blockchain technology makes it easy to
        verify ownership and transfer tokens between owners. The creator can
        also store specific information in an NFT's metadata. For instance,
        artists can sign their artwork by including their signature in the file.
